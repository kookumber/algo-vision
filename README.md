## Algovision

[Live Link](https://algovision-project.netlify.app/)

Algovision is a React application that visualizes Pathfinding/Traversal and Sorting algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Depth First Traversal, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and more. I built this to practice algorithms and better understand them.

Credit goes to [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak) and [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for the inspiration and guidance as I worked through this project.

### Users can:
* Toggle between Pathfinding/Traversal or Sorting algorithms view
* Build and clear a maze and move start/end nodes on the pathfinding grid
* Select specific algorithms and run them
* Adjust speed of animation
* Adjust array size for sorting algorithms

## Technologies
* Javascript, React, SASS, HTML5

## Hosting
* Netlify
